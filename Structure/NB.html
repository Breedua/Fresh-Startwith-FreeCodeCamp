            <h1>My Return back to tech</h1>
            <p>My journey back into tech as a beautiful girl who deeply regrets giving it up in the first place and who now wants to start learning from scratch allover again and also learn DevOps.</p>
            <p>Maybe i should keep a hard copy journal after all. I tried keeping a voice journal but my phone crashed and i lost all my journals on the notes app.</p>
            <p>I'm not ashamed to admit that there a alot of things i regret in my life, and one of them is not starting tech between 2018-2020. And worse of all is dumping tech in september of 2023 to do nothing. Now i just want to move forward and do all i ca. I cannot turn back the hands of time so i will make sure to utilize every single spare second i have been gifted.</p>
